# Example code
This is a repository to show off some of my script which are not covered by NDAs or being prepared for publication and can therefore be shared. All of the code has been authored by myself for several project I was working on at the time.

Here's a quick explanation for what the programs do:
- **aiSource.py:** The script can be used to predict sources from whole genomic sequencing of human campylobacteriosis cases and is further described in it's own [repository](https://github.com/narning1992/aiSource)
- **case_study_nicolas_arning.py:** A case study I did for an interview, wherein I do some initial data exploration and then predict Asthma from patient data using gradient boosting.
- **data_preprocessing.py:** A data preprocessing script I wrote for a risk factor analysis
- **make_starting_groups.py:** A script producing chain initialisations for MCMC algorithms
- **postpostprocessing.py:** Produces many different tables and figures for the output of a risk factor analysis

Have fun exploring. Any question please send me an [email](mailto:n.arning@gmx.de)
